## Hello there ðŸ‘‹! 

 ## I'm Tahjg "Teejay" Dixon, an Software Engineer residing in Las Vegas, NV.
 
 I enjoy coding and learning new languages and frameworks to implement into my projects. I'm familiar with JavaScript, ReactJS, Ruby, and Rails. I enjoy the UI/UX side of things as well. I have a big eye for aesthetics. You can check out my currently built projects here on github.
